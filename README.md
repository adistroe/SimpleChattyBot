### About
This is the ***Simple Chatty Bot*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding.</p>
<p>During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
